// Playback events — the OUTPUT-side (Core→UI) playback messages on the EventBus (D9).
//   PlaybackService publishes these when its state changes; App subscribes today (updating the
//   runtime handles the UI still reads), and the UI / remote will subscribe directly in later
//   increments. These replace the D8b-2 attach() callback seam: the message bus is now the only
//   service→App channel for playback state (M1: "bus = the only channel").
//
//   EventBus dispatch is SYNCHRONOUS on the publisher's thread, so replacing the callbacks with
//   these events preserves threading & ordering exactly (play_current / on_playback_ended publish
//   on the UI thread; record_play_history publishes HistoryChanged on a pool thread).
